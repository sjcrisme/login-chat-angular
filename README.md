## AngularJS Task
### Test - Create simple chat just on Angular 1.x side:

##### You have two pages:
- 1. Login page. - /login
- 2. Chat page. - /

##### Login: admin   Password:admin

#### Requirements:
- 1. If you are not logged in you should be redirected to /login.
- 2. On login page you can type your name (app should remember your name next time).
- 3. After logging you need to be redirected to the chat page.
- 4. On the chat page you can type a message and push it to the list of messages.
- 5. A message should has author, time and content.
- 6. Randomly you also need to push messages to the chat from mocked json (with messages) to simulate other users activity.
- 7. You should add sound after sending message.

Don't worry about styling - just functionality is important.
I recommend you to use webapp generator (e.g. https://github.com/FountainJS/generator-fountain-webapp) to quick start.
