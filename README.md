## AngularJS Task  Login-Chat-App
### Test - Create simple chat just on Angular 1.x side:

##### You have two pages:
- Login page. - /login
- Chat page. - /

##### Login: admin   Password:admin

#### Requirements:
- If you are not logged in you should be redirected to /login.
- On login page you can type your name (app should remember your name next time).
- After logging you need to be redirected to the chat page.
- On the chat page you can type a message and push it to the list of messages.
- A message should has author, time and content.
- Randomly you also need to push messages to the chat from mocked json (with messages) to simulate other users activity.
- You should add sound after sending message.

Don't worry about styling - just functionality is important.
I recommend you to use webapp generator (e.g. https://github.com/FountainJS/generator-fountain-webapp) to quick start.

### To run App you need:
- clone
- bower install
- npm start
